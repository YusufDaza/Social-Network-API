# Social Network API

## Description

### What was your motivation?
- The motivation was to create an API for a social network startup that could handle large amounts of unstructured data. This reflects the common need in social media platforms where user-generated content varies widely.

### Why did you build this project? 
- The project was built to address the scalability and flexibility challenges faced by social media startups. By using a NoSQL database like MongoDB and designing an API around it, the goal was to efficiently manage and scale as the user base and data volume grow.

### What problem does it solve?
- The project solves the problem of handling unstructured data efficiently. NoSQL databases like MongoDB are well-suited for this purpose, making them a good choice for social networks where data formats can vary greatly. By using MongoDB and designing an API around it, the social network can effectively manage and scale as it grows.

### What did you learn?
- From this project, I learned about NoSQL databases and their advantages over traditional SQL databases for handling unstructured data. I also gained experience in API design, data modeling using Mongoose for MongoDB, API testing with tools like Insomnia, and understanding scalability considerations for social media platforms.
